# gitlab-sync-all
GitLab Sync All is a PowerShell script that automates cloning and updating all repositories from a GitLab group, including subgroups. It detects system language, supports multiple languages via a JSON file, handles authentication with a personal access token, and ensures all repos are up-to-date using git pull or clone.
